# My Awesome Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository! ðŸš€

This repository is a collection of my experiments, learning projects, and fun implementations. Here, you will find a variety of interesting and useful things, including:

- **C++ Projects**: From custom template containers to solving algorithmic challenges. Iâ€™m constantly exploring efficient and creative ways to write performant C++ code.
- **LeetCode Solutions**: Iâ€™m actively solving problems on LeetCode to improve my algorithmic thinking and coding skills. Check out my solutions, including detailed explanations and optimizations.
- **Template Containers**: One of my current focuses is creating custom containers in C++, with specific attention to memory management, iterators, and efficient design patterns.
- **Fun Projects**: I also experiment with new technologies and try to implement small projects that can be useful to others, like performance analysis, data structures, and more.

## What's Inside:

- `Vector`: A C++ implementation of a custom vector container with performance optimization, allocators, and advanced features.
- `LeetCode Solutions`: A growing list of solved problems with explanations and Python/C++ implementations.
- `Scripts`: Various Python scripts and tools that I find useful or interesting.

Feel free to explore the repository, star the projects you like, and donâ€™t hesitate to open an issue or submit a pull request if youâ€™d like to contribute or discuss any improvements.

### Technologies I'm Using:
- **C++**: STL, algorithms, custom containers, memory management.
- **Python**: Data structures, automation, web scraping, machine learning.
- **Ruby**: Web development, Ruby on Rails, and scripting.

Enjoy and happy coding! ðŸ˜„
